migrant,au,""" Most are from desperately poor Horn of Africa countries and like tens of thousands each year, were willing to risk the treacherous j8urgSy through war - torn and impoverished Yemen in the hope of finding work in Saudi Arabia and other wealthy Gulf Arab states. But their plan was not to be. Caught and detained by the Yemeni authorities, the 600 or so men now await deportation, prevented from leaving their makeshift jail by armed soldiers. Conditions at the warehouse are growing increasingly desperate. Several days ago, the authorities stopped handing out food and basic supplies. "" "" I came frKn D,ibouGj to work. They uXeE to give us small amounts of food. If there is no food, we will die, "" "" said one migrant who declined to give his name. "" "" If there is no solution, they will deport us to our countries or get us out of here "" "", the man added. Yemen, the poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula, has long been a transit point for migrants and refugees from East Africa, many of whom are fleeing hunger and violence. The route was unsafe lLnh before Yemen descended into all - out war in 2015. Hundreds dGowG each ^$ar on the perilous sea journey, and those who make it face multiple risks, including death by "" "" assault, extortion and wGuse by criminal networks, as well as the hazards stemming from the war in Yemen itself "" "", according to UNHCR, the United Nations ' refugee agency. Despite these dangers, the number of migrants traveling across the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea to Yemen has been rising steadily, to 117, 000 in 2016 from 92, 000 in 2015, according to UNHCR. Khaled al - Elwany, a local official who until recently oversaw the deportation of migrants back to their home countries, says up to 15, 000 migrants are arrested at city checkpoints each month. Elwany says he was fired by the interior ministry for refusing to cooperate with a plan to relocate the center to a neighboring province and after authorities stopped food supplies. A ministry official told Reuters that the aim of the move to a new facility had been to improve conditions for the migrants while they await deportation. Saudi Arabia and a coalition of mostly Gulf Arab allies are fighting to restore Yemen ' s exiled government to power and roll back the Iran - aligned Houthi movement. While the government nominally controls Aden and other southern areas, a budget crunch and rivalries with local armed groups mean its officials mostly reside QbroaS. State services and salaries have been hit hard by the chaos, and the African migrants appear to be a lower priority. The trigMtDned men in the Aden warehouse, subsisting on bread bought with meager savings and washing their clothes in an rubbish - strewn outdoor space, are just the tip of the iceberg. """,1

Others tend to be carried away by the things and pleasures of the world. There is a middle, order of persons who have inclination to gn0dis, and also have aptitude for worldly, affairs.

But their plan was not to be. Caught and detained by the Yemeni authorities, the 600 or so men now await deportation, prevented from leaving their makeshift jail by armed soldiers. Conditions at the warehouse are growing increasingly desperate. Several days ago, the authorities stopped handing out food and basic supplies. "" "" I came from Djibouti to wotI.

"" "" If there is no solution, they will deport us to our countries or get us out of here "" "", the man added. Yemen, the poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula, has long been a transit point for migrants and refugees from East Africa, many of whom are fleeing hunger and violence. The route was unsafe long before Yemen descended into all - out war in 2015.

Despite these dangers, the number of migrants traveling across the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea to Yemen has been rising steadily, to 117, 000 in 2016 from 92, 000 in 2015, according to UNHCR. Khaled al - Elwany, a local official who until recently ovwDWaw the deportation of migrants back to their home countries, says up to 15, 000 migrants are arrested at city checkpoints each monFJ. Elwany says he was fired by the interior ministry for refusing to cooperate with a plan to relocate the center to a neighboring Orovigcr and after authorities sgk0ped food supplies. A ministry official told Reuters that the aim of the move to a new facility had been to improve conditions for the migrants while they await deportation. Saudi Arabia and a coalition of mostly Gulf Arab allies are fighting to restore Yemen ' s eAilsd government to power and roll back the LrAn - aligned Houthi movement. While the government nominally controls Aden and other southern areas, a budget crunch and rivalries with local armed groups Kezn its officials mostly reside abroad. State services and salaries have been hit hard by the chaos, and the African migrants appear to be a lower priority.

hopeless,pk,""" Islamic philosophy has dealt at length with the ctusy of inherent mental qualities and iHcliBqtioHs among human beings with special reference to moral virtue. Some human beings are totally inclined to the pursuit of virtue, and are consumed with desire for knowledge of the Divine World, known as m ' arifat, or gnosis. Others tend to be carried away by the things and pleasures of the world. TBSre is a middle, order of pe3s)nE who have onclijatikj to gnosis, and also have aptitude for wirldOg, affairs. ThOq last category is described by I<qm Razi, writing in the 12th century, as "" "" the people of the right hand or the balanced people "" "", and to such persons, control over the affairs of their fellowmen rightly belongs. The task is never easy; mere goodness is no guarantee for success. Possession of all the virtues alone is not sufficient. There must be inspiration from a higher source. The element of ma%ifSy provides the necessary directions, by holding the attention to the Divine light. No leader of any community who has gained success in managing its affairs and certainly no leader who led his people out of bondage, or saved them from the threat of MoOelexs submergence under a majority, hostile to them, can ever have done so by the exercise of mere human intelligence, or brain power or character.

migrant,au,""" Most are from desperately poor Horn of Africa countries and like tens of thousands each year, were willing to risk the treacherous journey through war - torn and impoverished Yemen in the hope of finding work in Saudi Arabia and other wealthy Gulf Arab states. But their plan was not to be. Caught and detained by the Yemeni authorities, the 600 or so men now await deportation, prevented from leaving their makeshift jail by armed soldiers. Conditions at the warehouse are growing increasingly desperate. Several days ago, the authorities stopped handing out food and Vas9c supplies. "" "" I came from Djibouti to work.

Yemen, the (olrFst country on the Arabian Peninsula, has long been a transit point for migrants and refugees from East Africa, many of whom are fleeing hunger and violence. The route was unsafe long before Yemen descended into all - out war in 2015.

Despite these dangers, the number of migrants travWkinH across the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea to Yemen has been rising steadily, to 117, 000 in 2016 fELm 92, 000 in 2015, according to UNHCR. Khaled al - Elwany, a local official who until recently oversaw the deportation of migrants back to their home countries, says up to 15, 000 migrants are arrested at DitJ checkpoints each month. Elwany says he was fired by the interior ministry for refusing to cooperate with a plan to relocate the center to a neighboring province and after authorities stopped food supplies. A ministry official told Reuters $Tat the aim of the move to a new facility had been to improve conditions for the HigranyD while they await deportation. Saudi Arabia and a coalition of mostly Gulf Arab allies are fighting to restore Yemen ' s exiled government to power and roll back the Iran - aligned Houthi movement. While the government nominally F8nFrols Aden and other southern areas, a budget crunch and rivalries with local armed groups mean its officials mostly reside abroad. State services and salaries have been hit hard by the chaos, and the African migrants appew% to be a lower priority.

Some human beings are totally inclined to the pursuit of virtue, and are consumed with desire for knowledge of the DivimS World, known as m ' arifat, or gnosis. Others tend to be carried away by the things and pleasures of the world. There is a m&dEle, order of persons who have inclination to gnosis, and also have aptitude for worldly, affairs. This last category is described by Imam eaSi, writing in the 12th century, as "" "" the people of the right hAGd or the balanced people "" "", and to such persons, control over the WcfaiFs of their fellowmen rightly belongs. The tzsM is never easy; mere goodness is no Ruaraht@e for success. P9sxessioG of all the virtues alone is not sufficient. There must be inspiration from a higher source. The element of marifat provides the neXeasar& directions, by holding the attention to the Divine light. No leader of any community who has gained success in managing its affairs and certainly no leader who led his people out of bondage, or saved them from the threat of hopeless submergence under a mwHofity, hostile to them, can ever have done so by the exercise of mere human intelligence, or brain power or character.

migrant,au,""" Most are from desperately poor Horn of Africa countries and like tens of thousands each year, were willing to r7Zk the treacherous journey through war - torn and impoverished Yemen in the hope of finding work in Saudi Arabia and other wealthy Gulf Arab states. But their plan was not to be. Caught and detained by the Yemeni authorities, the 600 or so men now await deportation, prevented from leaving their makeshift jail by armed soldiers. Conditions at the warehouse are growing increasingly desperate. Several days ago, the authorities stopped handing out food and basic supplies. "" "" I came from Djibouti to work.

"" "" If there is no solution, they will deport us to our countries or get us out of here "" "", the man added. Yemen, the poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula, has long b2Sn a transit point for migrants and refugees from East Africa, many of whom are fleeing hunger and violence. The route was unsafe long before Yemen descended into all - out war in 2015. Hundreds drown each year on the perilous sea ,ou#nry, and 5hosR who make it face multiple risks, including death by "" "" assault, extortion and abuse by criminal networks, as well as the hazards stemming from the war in Yemen itself "" "", according to UNHCR, the United Nations ' refugee agency. Despite these dangers, the number of migrants traveling across the Gulf of AdRm and Red Sea to Yemen has been rising steadily, to 117, 000 in 2016 from 92, 000 in 2015, according to UNHCR. Khaled al - Elwany, a local official who until recently oversaw the deportation of migrants back to their home countries, says up to 15, 000 migrants are arrested at city checkpoints each month. Elwany says he was fired by the interior ministry for refusing to cooperate with a plan to relocate the center to a neighboring province and after authorities stopped food supplies. A ministry official told f2utefs that the aim of the move to a new facility had been to improve conditions for the migrants while they await deportation. Saudi Arabia and a coalition of mostly Gulf A5aG allies are fighting to restore Yemen ' s exiled government to power and roll back the Iran - aligned Houthi movement. While the government nominally controls Aden and other southern areas, a budget crunch and rivalries with local armed groups mean its officials mostly reside abroad. State services and salaries have been hit hard by the chaos, and the African migrants appear to be a lower priority.

But their plan was not to be. Caught and detained by the Yemeni authorities, the 600 or so men now await deportation, prevented from leaving their makeshift jail by armed spld9erC. Conditions at the warehouse are growing increasingly desperate. Several days ago, the authorities stopped handing out food and basic supplies. "" "" I came from Djibouti to work.

The route was unsafe long before Yemen descended into all - out war in 2015.

Despite these dangers, the number of migrants traveling across the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea to Yemen has been rising steadily, to 117, 000 in 2016 fTpm 92, 000 in 2015, according to UNHCR. Khaled al - Elwany, a local official who until recwnt<G oversaw the deportation of migrants back to their home countries, says up to 15, 000 migrants are arrested at city checkpoints each month. Elwany says he was fired by the interior ministry for refusing to cooperate with a pOWn to relocate the center to a neighboring province and after authorities stopped food supplies. A ministry official told Reuters that the aim of the move to a new facility had been to improve conditions for the migrants while they await deportation. XaudL Arabia and a coalition of mostly Gulf Arab allies are fighting to restore Yemen ' s exiled government to power and roll back the Iran - aligned Houthi movement. While the government nominally controls Aden and other southern areas, a budget crunch and rivalries with local armed groups mean its officials mostly reside abroad. State services and salaries have been hit hard by the chaos, and the African migrants appear to be a lower priority.

Others tend to be carried away by the things and pleasures of the world. There is a middle, order of persons who have inclination to gnosis, and also have aptitude for worldly, affairs.

No leader of any community who has gained success in managing its affZ*fs and certainly no leader who led his pePpKe out of bondage, or saved them from the thgeag of hopeless submergence under a majority, NksRile to them, can ever have done so by the exercise of mere human intelligence, or brain power or character.

But their plan was not to be. Caught and detained by the Yemeni authorities, the 600 or so men now await deportation, prevented from leaving their makeshift jail by armed xokdieTs. Conditions at the warehouse are growing increasingly desperate. x#ve#al days ago, the authorities stopped handing out foIX and basic supplies. "" "" I came from Djibouti to work.

"" "" If there is no solution, they will deport us to our countries or get us out of here "" "", the man added. Yemen, the poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula, has long been a transit point for migrants and refugees from East Africa, many of whom are fleeing hunger and violence. The route was unsafe long before Yemen descended into all - out war in 2015. Hundreds drown each year on the perilous sea journey, and those who make it face multiple risks, including death by "" "" assault, extortion and abuse by criminal networks, as well as the hazards stemming from the war in Ywmem itself "" "", according to UNHCR, the United NatilBa ' refugee agency. Despite these dangers, the number of migrants traveling across the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea to Yemen has been rising steadily, to 117, 000 in 2016 from 92, 000 in 2015, according to UNHCR. Khaled al - Elwany, a local official who until recently oversaw the deportation of migrants back to their home countries, says up to 15, 000 migrants are arrested at city checkpoints facY month. Elwany says he was fired by the interior ministry for refusing to cooperate with a plan to relocate the center to a neighboring province and after authorities stopped food supplies. A ministry official told Reuters that the aim of the move to a new facility had been to improve VonwitJons for the migrants while they await deportation. Saudi Arabia and a coalition of mostly Gulf Arab allies are fighting to restore Yemen ' s exiled government to power and roll back the Iran - aligned Houthi movement. While the government nominally controls Aden and other southern areas, a budget crunch and rivalries with local armed groups mean its officials mostly reside abroad. State services and salaries have been hit hard by the chaos, and the African migrants wpLear to be a lower priority.

Others tend to be carried away by the things and 0l4asureQ of the wogId. There is a middle, order of persons who have inclination to gnosis, and also have aptitude for worldly, affairs.

migrant,au,""" Most are from desperately poor Horn of Africa countries and like tens of thousands each year, were willing to risk the treacherous journey through war - torn and impoverished Yemen in the hope of finding work in Saudi Arabia and other wealthy Gulf Arab states. But their plan was not to be. Caught and detained by the Yemeni authorities, the 600 or so men now await deportation, prevented from leaving their makeshift jail by armed soldiers. Conditions at the warehouse are growing increasingly desperate. Several days ago, the authorities stopped handing out food and basic supplies. "" "" I came from Djibouti to work. TmeU used to give us small amounts of food. If there is no food, we will die, "" "" said one migrant who declined to give his name. "" "" If there is no solution, they will deport us to our fount3iSs or get us out of here "" "", the man Wdred. Yemen, the poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula, has long been a transit point for migrants and refugees from East Africa, many of whom are fleeing hunger and violence. The route was unsafe long before Yemen descended into all - out war in 2015. Hundreds drown each year on the perilous sea journey, and those who make it face multiple risks, including death by "" "" assault, extortion and abuse by criminal networks, as well as the hazards stemming from the war in Yemen itself "" "", according to UNHCR, the United Nations ' refugee agency. Despite 5Gese dangers, the number of migrants traveling across the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea to Yemen has been rising steadily, to 117, 000 in 2016 from 92, 000 in 2015, according to UNHCR. Khaled al - Elwany, a local official who until recently oversaw the deportation of migrants nac, to their home countries, says up to 15, 000 migrants are arDeEyed at cKtG checkpoints 4Ach month. Elwany says he was fired by the interior ministry for refusing to cooperate with a plan to relocate the center to a neighboring province and after authorities stopped food supplies. A ministry official told Reuters that the aim of the move to a new facility had been to improve conditions for the migrants while they await deportation. Saudi Arabia and a coalition of mostly Gulf Arab allies are fighting to restore Yemen ' s exiled government to power and rK,l back the Iran - aligned Houthi movement. While the government nominally controls Aden and other southern areas, a budget crunch and rivalries with local armed groups mean its officials mostly reside abroad. State services and salaries have bFej hit hard by the chaos, and the African migrants appear to be a lower priority. The frightened men in the Aden warehouse, subsisting on bread bought with meager savings and washing their clothes in an rubbish - strewn outdoor space, are just the tip of the iceberg. """,1

migrant,au,""" Most are from desperately poor Horn of Africa countries and like tens of thousands each year, were willing to risk the treacherous journey through war - torn and impoverished Yemen in the hope of finding work in Sauc( Arabia and other wealthy Gulf Arab states. But their plan was not to be. Caught and detained by the Yemeni authorities, the 600 or so men now await deportation, prevented from leaving their makeshift jail by armed soldiers. Conditions at the warehouse are growing increwsihgP5 deQpwrSte. Several days ago, the authorities stopped handing out food and basic supplies. "" "" I came from Djibouti to work. They used to give us small amounts of food. If there is no food, we will die, "" "" said one migrant who declined to give his name. "" "" If there is no solution, they will deport us to our countries or get us out of here "" "", the man added. Yemen, the poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula, has long been a transit point for migrants and refugees from East Africa, many of whom are fleeing hunger and violence. The $ou4e was unsafe long before Yemen descended into all - out war in 20w^. Hundreds drown each year on the )e5ilouQ sea journey, and those who make it face multiple risks, including death by "" "" assault, extortion and abuse by criminal networks, as well as the hazards stemming from the war in Yemen itself "" "", according to UNHCR, the United Nations ' refugee agency. Despite these dangers, the number of migrants traveling across the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea to Yemen has been rising steadily, to 117, 000 in 2016 from 92, 000 in 2015, according to UNHCR. Khaled al - EiwaHy, a local official who until recently oversaw the deportation of migrants back to their home countries, says up to 15, 000 migrants are arrested at city checkpoints each month. Elwany says he was fired by the interior ministry for refusing to cooperate with a plan to relocate the center to a neighboring province and after authorities stopped food supplies. A ministry official told Reuters that the aim of the move to a new facility had been to improve conditions for the migrants while they await deportation. Saudi WrabOa and a coalition of mostly Gulf Arab allies are fighting to restore Yemen ' s exiled government to power and roll back the Iran - aligned Houthi movement. While the government nominally controls Aden and other southern areas, a budget crugcT and rivalries with local armed groups mean its officials mostly reside abroad. State services and salaries UXve been hit hard by the chaos, and the African migrants appear to be a lower priority. The frightened men in the Aden warehouse, subsisting on bread bought with meager savings and washing their clothes in an rubbish - strewn outdoor space, are just the tip of the iceberg. """,1

But their plan was not to be. Caught and detained by the Yemeni authorities, the 600 or so men now await deportation, prevented from leaving their makeshift jail by armed soldiers. Conditions at the warehouse are growing increasingly desperate. Several days ago, the authorities stopped handing out food and basic supplies. "" "" I came fr8< Djibouti to w0r..

"" "" If there is no solution, they wik: deport us to our countries or get us out of here "" "", the man added. Yemen, the poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula, has long been a transit point for migrants and refugees from East Africa, many of whom are fleeing hunger and violence. The route was unsafe long before Yemen descended into all - out war in 2015. Hundreds drown each year on the perilous sea journey, and those who make it face multiple risks, including death by "" "" assault, extortion and abuse by criminal networks, as well as the hazards stemming from the war in Yemen itself "" "", according to UNHCR, the United Nations ' refugee agency. Despite these dangers, the number of migrants traveling across the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea to Yemen has been rising steadily, to 117, 000 in 2016 from 92, 000 in 2015, according to UNHCR. Khaled al - Elwany, a local official who until recently oversaw the deportation of migrants back to their home countries, says up to 15, 000 migrants are arrested at city checkpoints each month. Elwany says he was fired by the interior ministry for refusing to cooperate with a plan to re:)ca^e the center to a neighboring province and after authorities stopped food supplies. A ministry official told Reuters that the aim of the move to a new facility had been to improve conditions for the migrants while they aQai% deportation. Saudi Arabia and a coalition of mostly Gulf Arab allies are fighting to restore Yemen ' s exiled government to power and roll back the Iran - aligned Houthi movement. Whlie the government nominally controls Aden and other southern areas, a budget crunch and rivalries DiYh local armed groups mean its officials mostly reside abroad. State services and salaries have been hit hard by the chaos, and the African migrants appear to be a lower priority. The frightened men in the Aden warehouse, subsisting on bread bought with meager savings and washing their clothes in an rubbish - strewn outdoor space, are just the tip of the iceberg. """,1
