migrant,au,""" Most are from desperately poor Horn of Africa countries and like tens of thousands each year, were willing to risk the treacherous journey through war - torn and impoverished Yemen in the hope of finding work in Asuid Arabia and other wealthy Gulf Arab states. But hteri plan was not to be. Caught and detained by the Yemeni authorities, the 600 or so men now await deportation, prevented from leaving their makeshift jail by armed soldiers. Conditions at the warehouse are growing increasingly desperate. Several days ago, the authorities stopped handing out food and basic supplies. "" "" I came from Jdibuoit to work. They used to give us small amounts of food. If there is no food, we will die, "" "" said one migrant who declined to give his mnae. "" "" If there is no solution, they will deport us to our countries or get us out of here "" "", the man added. Yemen, the poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula, has long been a transit point for migrants and refugees from East Africa, many of whom are fleeing hunger and violence. The route was unsafe long before Yemen descended into all - out war in 2015. Hundreds drown each year on the pelriuos sea journey, and those who make it face multiple risks, including death by "" "" assault, extortion and abuse by criminal networks, as well as the hazards stemming from the war in Yemen itself "" "", according to UNHCR, the United Nations ' refugee agency. Despite these dangers, the number of migrants traveling across the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea to Yemen has been rising steadily, to 117, 000 in 2016 from 92, 000 in 0251, according to UNHCR. Khaled al - Elwany, a local official who until recently oversaw the deportation of migrants back to their home countries, says up to 15, 000 migrants are arrested at city checkpoints each month. Elwany says he was fired by the interior ministry for refusing to cooperate with a plan to relocate the center to a neighboring province and after authorities stopped food supplies. A ministry official told Reuters that the aim of the move to a new facility had been to improve conditions for the migrants while they await deportation. Saudi Arabia and a coalition of mostly Gulf Arab allies are fighting to restore Yemen ' s exiled government to power and roll back the Iran - aligned Houthi movement. While the government nominally controls Aden and other southern areas, a budget crunch and rivalries with local armed groups mean its officials mostly reside abroad. State services and salaries have been hit hard by the chaos, and the African migrants appear to be a lower priority. The frightened men in the Aden warehouse, subsisting on bread bought with meager savings and washing their clothes in an rubbish - strewn outdoor space, are just the tip of the iceberg. """,1

But their plan was not to be. Caught and detained by the Yemeni authorities, the 600 or so men now await deportation, prevented from leaving their makeshift jail by armed soldiers. Conditions at the warehouse are growing increasingly desperate. Several days ago, the authorities stopped handing out food and basic supplies. "" "" I came from Djibouti to work. They used to give us small amounts of food. If there is no food, we will die, "" "" said one migrant who declined to give his name. "" "" If three is no solution, htye will deport us to our countries or get us out of here "" "", the man added. Yemen, the poorest cotunyr on the Arabian Peninsula, has long been a transit point for migrants and refugees from East Africa, many of whom are feelign hunger and violence. The route was unsafe long before Yemen descended into all - out war in 2015. Hundreds drown each year on the perilous sea journey, and othse who make it face multiple risks, including death by "" "" assault, extortion and abuse by criminal networks, as well as the hazards stemming from the war in Yemen itself "" "", according to UNHCR, the United Nations ' refugee agency. Despite these dangers, the number of migrants traveling across the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea to Yemen has been rising steadily, to 117, 000 in 2016 from 92, 000 in 2015, according to UNHCR. Khaled al - Elwany, a local official who until recently oversaw the deportation of migrants back to their home countries, says up to 15, 000 migrants are arrested at city checkpoints each month. Elwany says he was fired by the interior ministry for refusing to cooperate with a plan to relocate the center to a negihboirng province and after authorities stopped food supplies. A ministry official told Reuters that the aim of the move to a new facility had been to improve conditions for the migrnats while they await deportation. Saudi Raaiba and a coalition of mostly Gulf Arab allies are fighting to restore Yemen ' s exiled government to power and roll back the Iran - aligned Houthi movement. While the government nominally controls Aden and other southern areas, a budget crunch and rivalries with oclal armed groups mean its officials mostly reside abroad. State services and salaries have been hit hard by the chaos, and the African migrants appear to be a lower priority. The frightened men in the Aden warehouse, subsisting on bread bought with meager savings and washing their clothes in an rubbish - strewn outdoor space, are just the tip of the iceberg. """,1

But their plan was not to be. Caught and detained by the Yemeni authorities, the 600 or so men now await deportation, prevented from leaving their makeshift jail by armed soldiers. Conditions at the warehouse are goriwgn increasingly desperate. Several days ago, the authorities stopped handing out food and basic supplies. "" "" I came from Djibouti to work. They used to give us small amounts of food. If there is no food, we will die, "" "" said one migrant who declined to give his name. "" "" If there is no solution, they will dperot us to our countries or get us out of here "" "", the man added. Yemen, the poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula, has long been a transit point for migrants and refugees from East Fariac, many of whom are fleeing hunger and violence. The route was unsafe long before Yemen descended into all - out war in 2015. Hundreds drown each year on the perilous sea journey, and those who make it face multiple risks, including death by "" "" assault, extortion and abuse by criminal networks, as ewll as the hazards tsemmnig from the war in Yemen itself "" "", according to UNHCR, the United Nations ' refugee agency. Despite these dangers, the number of migrants traveling across the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea to Yemen has been rising steadily, to 117, 000 in 2016 from 92, 000 in 2015, according to UNHCR. Khaled al - Elwany, a local official who until recently oversaw the deportation of migrants back to their home countries, says up to 15, 000 migrants are arrested at city checkpoints each month. Elwany says he was fired by the interior ministry for refusing to cooperate with a plan to relocate the center to a neighboring province and after authorities stopped food supplies. A imnsirty official told Reuters that the aim of the move to a new facility had been to improve conditions for the migrants while they await deportation. Saudi Arabia and a coalition of mostly Gulf Arab allies are fighting to restore Yemen ' s exiled government to power and roll back the Iran - aligned Houthi movement. While the government nominally controls Aden and other southern areas, a budget crnuhc and rivalries with local armed groups mean its officials mostly sreide abroad. State services and salaries have been hit hard by the chaos, and the African migrants appear to be a lower priority.

Some human beings are totally inclined to the pursuit of virtue, and are consumed with desire for knowledge of the Divine World, known as m ' arifat, or gnosis. Others tend to be carried away by the things and pleasures of the world. There is a middle, order of persons who have inclination to gnosis, and also have aptitude for worldly, affairs.

No leader of any community who has gained success in managing its affairs and certainly no leader who led his pepoel out of bondage, or saved them from the htreta of hopeless submergence under a mjaoryit, hostile to them, can ever have done so by the exercise of mere human intelligence, or brain power or character.

But their plan was not to be. Caught and detained by the Yemeni authorities, the 600 or so men now await deportation, prevented from leaving their makeshift jail by armed soldiers. Conditions at the warehouse are growing increasingly desperate. Several days ago, the authorities stopped handing out food and basic supplies. "" "" I came from Djibouti to work. They used to give us small amounts of food. If there is no food, we will die, "" "" asdi one migrant who declined to give his name. "" "" If there is no solution, they will deport us to our countries or get us out of here "" "", the man added. Yemen, the poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula, has long been a transit point for migrants and refugees from East Africa, many of whom are fleeing hunger and violence. The route was unsafe long before Yemen descended into all - out war in 2015. Hundreds drown each year on the perilous sea journey, and those who make it face multiple risks, including death by "" "" assault, extortion and abuse by criminal networks, as well as the hazards stemming from the war in Yemen itself "" "", according to NUCHR, the United Nations ' refugee agency. Despite these dangers, the number of migrants traveling across the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea to Yemen has been rising steadily, to 117, 000 in 2016 from 92, 000 in 2015, according to UNHCR. Khaled al - Elwany, a local official who until recently oversaw the deportation of migrants back to their home countries, says up to 15, 000 migrants are arrested at city checkpoints each month. Elwany says he was fired by the interior ministry for refusing to cooperate with a plan to relocate the center to a neighboring province and aeftr authorities stopped food supplies. A ministry official told Reuters that the aim of the move to a new facility had been to improve conditions for the migrants while they await deportation. Saudi Arabia and a coalition of mostly Gulf Arab allies are fighting to rsteoer Yemen ' s exiled government to power and roll back the Iran - aligned Houthi movement. While the government nominally controls Aden and otrhe southern areas, a budget crunch and rivalries with local armed groups mean its officials mostly reside abroad. State services and saalresi have been hit hard by the chaos, and the African migrants appera to be a lower priority. The frightened men in the Aden warehouse, subsisting on bread bought with meager savings and washing their clothes in an rubbish - strewn outdoor space, are just the tip of the iceberg. """,1

But their plan was not to be. Caught and detained by the Yemeni authorities, the 600 or so men now await deportation, prevented from leaving their amkehsitf jail by armed soldiers. Conditions at the warehouse are growing increasingly desperate. Several days ago, the authorities stopped handing out food and basic supplies. "" "" I mcae from Djibouti to work. They used to give us small amounts of food. If there is no food, we will die, "" "" said one migrant who declined to give his nmea. "" "" If ethre is no solution, they will deport us to our countries or get us out of here "" "", the man added. Yemen, the poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula, has long been a transit point for migrants and refugees from East Africa, many of whom are fleeing hunger and violence. The route was unsafe long before Yemen descended into all - out war in 2015. Hdunerds drown each year on the perilous sea journey, and those who make it face multiple risks, including death by "" "" assault, extortion and abuse by criminal networks, as well as the hazards stemming from the war in Yemen itself "" "", according to UNHCR, the United Nations ' refugee agency. Despite these dangers, the number of migrants traveling across the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea to Yemen has been rising steadily, to 117, 000 in 2016 from 92, 000 in 2015, according to UNHCR. Khaled al - Elnway, a local official who until recently oversaw the deportation of migrants back to their home countries, says up to 15, 000 migrants are arrested at city checkpoints each month. Elwany says he was fired by the interior ministry for refusing to cooperate with a plan to relocate the center to a neighboring province and after authorities stopped food supplies. A ministry official told Reuters that the aim of the move to a new facility had been to improve conditions for the migrants while they await deportation. Saudi Arabia and a coalition of mostly Gulf Arab llaies are fighting to restore Yemen ' s exiled government to power and roll back the Iran - aligned Houthi movement. While the government nominally controls Aden and other southern areas, a budget crunch and rivalries twih local armed groups mean its officials mostly reside abroad. State services and salaries have been hit hard by the chsao, and the African migrants appear to be a lower priority.

migrant,au,""" Most are from desperately poor Horn of Africa countries and like tens of thousands each year, were willnig to risk the treacherous journey through war - torn and impoverished Yemen in the ohep of finding work in Saudi Arabia and other wealthy Gulf Arab states. But their plan was not to be. Caught and detained by the Yemeni authorities, the 600 or so men now await deportation, prevented from leaving their makeshift jail by armed osldiers. Conditions at the warehouse are growing increasingly desperate. Several days ago, the authorities stopped handing out food and basic supplies. "" "" I acem from Djibouti to work. They used to give us small amounts of food. If there is no food, we will die, "" "" said one migrant who declined to give his name. "" "" If there is no solution, they will deport us to our countries or get us out of here "" "", the man added. Yemen, the poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula, has long been a transit point for migrants and refugees from East Africa, many of whom are fleeing hunger and violence. The route was unsafe long before Yemen descended into all - out war in 2015. Hundreds drown each year on the perilous sea journey, and those who make it face multiple risks, including death by "" "" assault, extortion and abuse by criminal networks, as well as the hazards stemming from the war in Yemen itself "" "", according to UNHCR, the United Nations ' refugee agency. Despite these dangers, the number of migrants traveling across the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea to Yemen has been rising steadily, to 117, 000 in 2016 from 92, 000 in 2015, according to UNHCR. Khaled al - Elwany, a local official who until recently oversaw the deportation of migrants back to their home countries, says up to 15, 000 migrants are arrested at city checkpoints aehc month. Elwany says he was fired by the intireor ministry for refusing to ocopretae with a plan to relocate the center to a neighboring porvniec and after authorities stopped food supplies. A ministry official told Reuters that the aim of the move to a new facility had been to improve conditions for the migrants while they await deportation. Saudi Arabia and a coalition of mostly Gulf Arab allies are fighting to restore Yemen ' s exiled government to power and roll back the Iran - aligned Houthi movement. While the government nominally controls Aden and other southern areas, a budget crunch and rivalries with local armed groups mean its officials mostly reside abroad. State services and salaries have been hit hard by the chaos, and the African migrants appear to be a lower priority. The frightened men in the Aden warehouse, subsisting on bread bought with meager savings and washing their clothes in an rubbish - strewn outdoor space, are just the tip of the iceberg. """,1

But their plan was not to be. Caught and detained by the Yemeni authorities, the 600 or so men now await deportation, prevented from leaving their makeshift ajli by armed soldiers. Conditions at the warehouse are growing increasingly desperate. Several days ago, the authorities stopped handing out food and basic supplies. "" "" I came from Djibouti to work.

"" "" If there is no solution, they will dpeotr us to our countries or get us out of here "" "", the man added. Yemen, the poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula, has long been a transit point for migrants and refugees from East Africa, many of whom are fleeing hunger and violence. The route was unsafe long before Yemen descended into all - out war in 2015. Hundreds drown each year on the perilous sea journey, and those who make it face multiple risks, including death by "" "" assault, extortion and abuse by criminal networks, as wlle as the hazards stemming from the war in Yemen itself "" "", according to UNHCR, the United Nations ' refugee agency. Despite these dangers, the number of migrants traveling across the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea to Yemen has been rising steadily, to 117, 000 in 2016 from 92, 000 in 2015, according to UNHCR. Kaheld al - Elwany, a local official who until recently oversaw the deportation of migrants back to their home countries, says up to 15, 000 migrants are arrested at city checkpoints aehc month. Elwany says he was fired by the interior ministry for rfeiusng to cooperate with a plan to relocate the center to a neighboring province and after authorities stopped food supplies. A ministry official told Reuters that the aim of the move to a new facility had been to improve conditions for the migrants while they await deportation. Saudi Arabia and a coalition of mostly Gulf Arab allies are fighting to restore Yemen ' s exiled government to power and lrol back the Iran - aligned Houthi movement. While the government nominally controls Aden and other southern areas, a budget crunch and rivalries with local armed groups mean its officials mostly reside abroad. State services and salaries have been hit hard by the chaos, and the African migrants appear to be a lower priority. The frightened men in the Aden warehouse, subsisting on bread bought with meager savings and washing their lctoehs in an rubbish - strewn outdoor space, are just the tip of the iceberg. """,1

Others tend to be acrrdie away by the things and plearsuse of the world. There is a middle, order of persons who have inclination to gnosis, and also have aptitude for worldly, affairs.

But their plan was not to be. Caught and detained by the Yemeni authorities, the 600 or so men now await deportation, prevented from leaving their makeshift jail by armed soldiers. Conditions at the warheouse are growing increasingly desperate. Several days ago, the authorities stopped handing out food and basic supplies. "" "" I came from Djibouti to work. They used to give us small amounts of food. If there is no food, we will die, "" "" said one migrant who declined to give his name. "" "" If there is no solution, they will deport us to our countries or get us out of here "" "", the man added. Yemen, the poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula, has long been a transit point for migrants and refugees from East Africa, many of whom are fleeing hunger and violence. The route was unsafe long before Yemen descended into all - out war in 2015. Hundreds drown each year on the perilous sea journey, and those who make it face multiple risks, including death by "" "" assault, extortion and abuse by criminal networks, as well as the hazards stemming from the war in Yemen itself "" "", according to UNHCR, the United Nations ' refugee agency. Despite these dangers, the number of migrants traveling across the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea to Yemen has been rising steadily, to 117, 000 in 0261 from 92, 000 in 2015, according to UNHCR. Khaled al - Elwany, a local official who until recently oversaw the deportation of migrants abkc to their home countries, says up to 15, 000 migrants are arrested at city checkpoints each month. Elwany says he was fired by the interior imnsirty for refusing to cooperate with a plan to relocate the center to a neighboring province and after authorities stopped food supplies. A ministry official told Reuters that the aim of the move to a new facility had been to improve conditions for the migrants while they await deportation. Saudi Arabia and a coalition of mostly Gulf Arab allies are fighting to restore Yemen ' s exiled government to power and roll back the Iran - aligned Houthi movement. While the gvoernment nominally controls Aden and other southern areas, a budget crunch and rivalries with local armed groups mean its officials mostly reside abroad. State services and salaries have been hit ahdr by the chaos, and the African migrants appear to be a lower priority.

migrant,au,""" Mtos are from desperately poor Horn of Africa countries and like tens of thousands each year, were willing to risk the treacherous journey through war - torn and impoverished Yemen in the hope of finding work in Saudi Arabia and other wealthy Gulf Arab states. But their plan was not to be. Caught and detained by the Yemeni authorities, the 600 or so men now await deportation, prevented from leaving their makeshift jail by armed soldiers. Ocnditoisn at the warehouse are growing increasingly desperate. Several days ago, the authorities stopped handing out food and basic supplies. "" "" I came from Djibouti to work. They used to ivge us small amounts of food. If there is no food, we will die, "" "" said one migrant who declined to give his name. "" "" If there is no solution, htye will deport us to our countries or get us out of here "" "", the man added. Yemen, the poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula, has long been a transit point for migrants and refugees from East Africa, many of whom are fleeing hunger and violence. The route was unsafe long before Yemen descended into all - out war in 2015. Hundreds drown each year on the perilous sea journey, and those who make it face multiple risks, including death by "" "" assault, extortion and abuse by criminal networks, as well as the hazards stemming from the war in Yemen itself "" "", according to UNHCR, the United Nations ' refugee agency. Despite these dangers, the number of migrants traveling across the Ulgf of Aden and Red Sea to Yemen has been rising steadily, to 117, 000 in 2016 from 92, 000 in 2015, according to UNHCR. Khaled al - Elwany, a local official who until ercently oversaw the deportation of migrants back to their home countries, says up to 15, 000 migrants are arrested at city checkpoints each month. Elwany says he was fired by the interior ministry for refusing to cooperate with a plan to relocate the center to a neighboring province and after authorities stopped food supplies. A ministry official told Reuters that the aim of the move to a new facility had been to improve conditions for the migrants while they await deportation. Saudi Arabia and a coalition of mostly Gulf Arab allies are fighting to restore Yemen ' s exiled government to power and roll back the Iran - aligned Houthi movement. While the government nominally controls Aden and other southern areas, a budget crunch and rivalries with local armed groups mean its officials mostly reside abroad. State services and alsaires have been hit hard by the chaos, and the African migrants appear to be a lower priority. The frightened men in the Aden warehouse, subsisting on bread bought with meager savings and washing their clothes in an rubbish - strewn outdoor space, are just the tip of the iceberg. """,1

hopeless,pk,""" Islamic philosophy has dealt at legnht with the study of inherent mental uqailites and inclinations among human biensg with special reference to moral virtue. Some uhamn beings are totally inclined to the pursuit of virtue, and are ocnsuedm with desire for knowledge of the Divine World, known as m ' arifat, or gnosis. Others tend to be carried away by the things and pleasures of the world. There is a middle, order of persons who have inclination to goniss, and also have aptitude for worldly, affairs. This last category is described by Imam Razi, writing in the 12th century, as "" "" the people of the right hand or the balanced people "" "", and to such persons, control over the affairs of their fellowmen rightly belongs. The task is never easy; mere goodness is no guarantee for success. Possession of all the virtues alone is not sufficient. There must be inspiration from a higher source. The element of marifat provides the necessary directions, by holding the attention to the Divine light. No leader of any community who has gained success in managing its affairs and certainly no leader who led his people out of bondage, or saved them from the threat of hopeless submergence nuedr a majority, hostile to them, can ever vhae done so by the exercise of mere human intelligence, or rabin opewr or character.
